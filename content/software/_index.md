All of the software I made public is available on [Github](https://github.com/tpapp/) under some open-source license, usually GPL or MIT. This includes [some libraries in Common Lisp](https://github.com/tpapp?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=common%20lisp), a language I no longer use, because I switched to [Julia](https://julialang.org/), used by [most of my recent libraries](https://github.com/tpapp?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=julia).

You can find the source for this site [on Github](https://github.com/tpapp/tpapp.github.io-source).
